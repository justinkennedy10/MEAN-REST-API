# Basic REST API using the MEAN Stack
#### By Justin Kennedy

- This REST server uses:
  - NodeJS with ExpressJS to serve content
  - MongoDB to store data
  - AngularJS to make a pretty web interface
- To start the server, you must
 1. Get MongoDB and start the service
 2. Install node, and run `node server.js` in your local repo
- If you have Ubuntu or apt-get, you can just run the script `start.sh`
